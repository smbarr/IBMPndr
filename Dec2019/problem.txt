Approximating absolute value.
Find an expression with no more than 15 operations (+, -, *, /) that approximates the absolute value function on the interval [-1,1] with an MSE (mean squared error) of no more than 0.0001.

For example, (x+1)/2 can be computed with only two operations and has an MSE of 1/6.


Bonus '*' for the best approximation (currently 1.803E-7).
